                    <p>
                        I have lived in 10 states over the years with three main chapters in my life leading up to now. Chapter one learning to work with horses at age 19, eventually managing horseback riding stables, outfitting and back-country guide and overall ranch management. <br>
                        Which lead to chapter two property management and maintenance. From ranch properties to single family housing and apartment complexes in between. <br>
                        After which I returned back to my home state of Utah for chapter three and my current occupation. Line service supervisor at SLC international airport.<br>
                        I am super excited to now embark upon chapter four. Learning to code at U of U boot camp and eventually becoming a successful developer. Applying all I have learned along the way with great dedication throughout this course... I look forward to working with YOU!
